//! Phase 3.4: ECS resources owned by the lockstep input pipeline.
//!
//! Sits in `comp::` (not `lockstep::`) because:
//!   1. The host omb dispatcher consumes them every tick, regardless of
//!      whether the kcp lockstep transport is active.
//!   2. The omfx sim_runner worker thread also writes to them (after
//!      converting `TickBatch` proto inputs to host `PlayerInput` types),
//!      so they must live in a module that's compiled in *all* feature
//!      configurations. `lockstep::` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "kcp")]`.
//!
//! `PlayerInput` (the prost-generated proto type re-exported from
//! `lockstep::PlayerInput`) is only available under `feature = "kcp"`. To
//! keep this module always-compiled, we store inputs as opaque
//! `serde_json::Value` here is a non-starter (lossy + serializing an empty
//! oneof is awkward). Instead the resource holds a feature-gated typed
//! payload and the consumer system also feature-gates. Non-kcp builds get
//! an empty resource that nothing writes to or reads from.
